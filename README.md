🌱 Python Garden — Basics
Growing Code · Python Fundamentals Through Garden Data

This repository is part of the Python Garden learning path and contains the exercises for the Basics module, also known as Growing Code.

The goal of this module is to introduce Python fundamentals through small, well-defined exercises inspired by community garden scenarios.
It focuses on understanding Python’s syntax, execution model, and core programming concepts in a progressive and controlled way.

This module is designed as a foundation: simple on purpose, strict by design, and essential for all subsequent modules.

🎯 Module Objectives

During this module, the learner works on:

Understanding Python’s execution flow

Learning the difference between defining and executing functions

Using variables and expressions correctly

Handling standard input and output inside functions

Applying conditionals, loops, and basic recursion

Reading and following a subject exactly as specified

Building confidence with Python before moving to advanced concepts

The emphasis is on clarity, correctness, and comprehension, not on optimization or architecture.

📐 Rules & Constraints

This module follows strict rules, as defined in the official subject:

Each file contains only one function

Functions are never executed inside the file

if __name__ == "__main__" is not allowed

Input (input) and output (print) are handled inside the function, when required

Only the authorized functions listed in each exercise may be used

Function names must match the subject exactly

Output text must match the examples character by character

Error handling is not required unless explicitly stated

For invalid or negative inputs, behavior is undefined

These constraints are intentional:
they reinforce how Python is evaluated automatically and how execution really works.

Each exercise introduces a single new concept, building gradually on what came before.

🧠 Learning Philosophy

This module follows a progressive and fundamental approach:

Solve small, concrete problems

Focus on what Python does, not just how to write it

Learn how functions are tested through imports

Prioritize exact correctness over elegance

Accept limitations as part of the learning process

This is not yet about reusable code, clean architecture, or best practices.
It is about understanding the language deeply and consciously.

🧪 Testing the Exercises

A helper file (main.py) is provided with the subject to make testing easier.

This helper:

Imports your functions automatically

Executes them without modifying your files

Helps you understand how imports work in Python

⚠️ The helper is for learning only and is not part of the submission.

🚀 Module Status

✔️ Module completed
✔️ Exercises validated manually
✔️ Fully compliant with the official subject
✔️ Clear understanding of the evaluation model
✔️ Solid foundation for future Python modules

🔗 What Comes Next

This Basics module prepares the ground for future projects, where concepts will be revisited with more depth:

More complex control flow

Data structures

Error handling

File and stream management

Object-Oriented Programming

Everything built here becomes reusable knowledge later — just in a more advanced form.
